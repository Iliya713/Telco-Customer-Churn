# Telco-Customer-Churn
Objective of the Analysis
1. Understand customer behavior by exploring the Telco Customer Churn dataset to identify patterns and factors associated with churn.

2. Clean and preprocess the data, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and addressing class imbalance.

3. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover relationships between customer attributes and churn tendency.

4. Build and evaluate predictive models (Logistic Regression and Random Forest) to classify whether a customer is likely to churn.

5. Apply SMOTE to handle class imbalance and improve the modelâ€™s ability to correctly detect churners.

6. Compare model performance before and after SMOTE using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

7. Generate actionable insights that can help businesses develop targeted strategies for improving customer retention and reducing churn.
